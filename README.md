# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe â€“ Java Console Game

Iâ€™m very excited to share this project â€” itâ€™s my **first Java project**, built while I was learning the language! ðŸ™Œ  
This is a simple **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** that runs in the console using core Java.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Java syntax and structure
- 2D arrays to represent the game board
- User input handling using `Scanner`
- Game logic for win, draw, and input validation
- Clean formatting in the console
